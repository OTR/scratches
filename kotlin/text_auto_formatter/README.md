# Project Desctiption

This is an education project in Kotlin. The purpose is to use new language's features as soon as learning them.
This is a program that takes some piece of a text and makes some predefined string formatting to it.
Such as trims extra spaces, puts a dot at the end of a sentence, puts a tab symbol before a paragraph and so on.
It also makes some addition measurement such as counts symbols, words, sentences, paragraphs.
